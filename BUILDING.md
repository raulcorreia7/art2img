# Building art2img

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **C++20 compiler** (GCC 10+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+)
- **CMake** 3.14+
- **pthread** (Linux only)

## üèóÔ∏è Build Instructions

### Quick Build
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/raulcorreia7/art2img.git
cd art2img
make all
```

### Makefile Commands
```bash
make all          # Build for Linux (default)
make build        # Build for Linux
make mingw-windows      # Cross-compile for Windows x64 using MinGW
make mingw-windows-x86  # Cross-compile for Windows x86 using MinGW
make linux-release       # Release build + tests for Linux
make mingw-windows-release     # Release build for Windows x64 using MinGW
make mingw-windows-x86-release # Release build for Windows x86 using MinGW
make test         # Run tests on Linux
make test-windows # Test Windows x64 build (requires Wine)
make test-windows-x86 # Test Windows x86 build (requires Wine)
make clean        # Clean build directory
make install      # Install to system
make doctor       # Check host dependencies
```

### Direct Script Usage
The build system uses dedicated scripts for each platform and cross-compilation target:

```bash
# Build for Linux natively
./scripts/build/native/linux.sh

# Cross-compile for Windows x64 from Linux (MinGW)
./scripts/build/cross/mingw-windows64.sh

# Cross-compile for Windows x86 from Linux (MinGW)
./scripts/build/cross/mingw-windows32.sh
```

Additionally, the following Makefile targets are available for cross-compilation:

```bash
make mingw-windows          # Cross-compile for Windows x64 using MinGW
make mingw-windows-x86      # Cross-compile for Windows x86 using MinGW
make mingw-windows-release  # Release build for Windows x64 using MinGW
make mingw-windows-x86-release # Release build for Windows x86 using MinGW
make test-windows           # Test Windows x64 build (requires Wine)
make test-windows-x86       # Test Windows x86 build (requires Wine)
```

### CMake Direct
```bash
mkdir -p build/linux-release && cd build/linux-release
cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --parallel
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Cross-Platform

### Windows (Cross-compilation from Linux)
```bash
make windows-release
# or configure manually
mkdir -p build/windows && cd build/windows
cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../cmake/windows-toolchain.cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF
cmake --build . --parallel
```

### Windows (Native - requires Windows system)
Native Windows builds (not cross-compilation) would require building on Windows with Visual Studio, MSYS2, or similar Windows development environments.
```

## üß™ Testing

```bash
make test                 # Run unit/integration tests on Linux
make test-windows         # Run Windows x64 tests under Wine
make test-windows-x86     # Run Windows x86 tests under Wine
./scripts/test_windows.sh functional-only build/windows-release # Functional tests only
```

## üê≥ Docker

```bash
docker build -t art2img .
docker run -v $(pwd):/app art2img make all
```
